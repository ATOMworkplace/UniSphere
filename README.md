## SITUATION

### Current Challenges in University Event Management

**Fragmented Communication Systems**
- Clubs rely on basic Google Forms for event registration, lacking advanced features like payment processing and automated confirmations
- Event announcements scattered across multiple platforms including WhatsApp groups, Instagram stories, LinkedIn posts, and email chains
- No centralized discovery system for students to find all university events in one place
- Limited interaction capabilities between club members and event organizers during planning phases

**Administrative Inefficiencies**
- Manual attendance tracking using paper-based systems or basic spreadsheets prone to errors
- No direct communication channel between administrators and specific student demographics or groups
- Difficulty in tracking event participation rates, engagement metrics, and student involvement patterns
- Absence of integrated payment processing for paid events, workshops, and club membership fees

**Community Engagement Issues**
- No unified platform for university-wide discussions, announcements, and community building initiatives
- Limited real-time communication capabilities during events, workshops, and club activities
- Lack of comprehensive system to showcase club achievements, member spotlights, and success stories
- Difficulty in coordinating volunteers, managing event logistics, and tracking task assignments

**Data Management Problems**
- Event data stored in isolated systems without integration or cross-platform accessibility
- No analytics or insights into student engagement patterns, popular events, or participation trends
- Manual processes for generating reports, tracking club performance, and measuring event success
- Inconsistent data collection methods across different clubs and organizational departments
